The mushroom is said to have gotten its name after people danced with happiness upon finding it in the wild, such are its incredible healing properties. This mushroom is a type of adaptogen. Adaptogens assist the body in fighting against any type of mental or physical difficulty. They also work to regulate systems of the body that have become unbalanced. While this mushroom can be used in recipes for taste alone, it’s considered to be a medicinal mushroom. The mushroom grows wild in parts of Japan, China, and North America. It grows at the bottom of Oak, Elm, and Maple trees. It can be cultivated and even grown at home, though it typically won’t grow as well as it does in the wild. You can usually find the mushroom during the autumn months.",

Alternately, called the bearded tooth fungus or the pom pom mushroom due to its highly textured surface, lion’s mane mushrooms are native to the mountains of northeast Asia and may also be found in Europe and North America. An important species in the traditional medicine of China, Korea, and Japan, where it has been used for thousands of years, lion’s mane has grown in popularity recently in part due to another nickname. Dubbed a “smart mushroom” because of its support for cognitive function and neurological health, lion’s mane is receiving attention all over the world for its exceptional brain supportive potential. Investigating lion’s mane mushroom benefits will help you to determine if this smart mushroom is something you need in your life.",
